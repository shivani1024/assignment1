//2. A straight line in two dimension can be represented with y=mx +c , where y and x are the y
//and x coordinates of the point on line in two dimension space respectively. m is slope of the line and
//c is intercept made by the line with y axis. Write a program that:
//a) Reads from end user using suitable messages :
//i. Slope m
//ii. Intercept c
//iii. Values of x
//b) Reads from end user using suitable messages: a random point ( xp , yp )
//c) Print with suitable message if ( xp, yp ) is on the line y=mx +c
